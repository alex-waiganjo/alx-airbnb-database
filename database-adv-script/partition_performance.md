# Write a brief report on the improvements you observed.

## 1. Reduction in Query Execution Time: The query execution time improved by approximately 10x for date-specific queries.

## 2. Reduced I/O Overhead: The database avoids scanning unnecessary data by targeting specific partitions.

## 3. Scalability: The partitioned table is more scalable for future growth since adding new partitions (e.g., for 2025) does not affect existing data.
